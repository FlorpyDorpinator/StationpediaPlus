## Plan: Stationpedia UI Enhancement & Guide System

**TL;DR:** Add new "Game Mechanics" entry type with dedicated button, create "Stationeers Survival Manual" wide button that opens a multi-part collapsible guide, make guide buttons half-size in two columns, and increase top logo by 15%. All home buttons identical in both modes; guide/mechanics pages follow vanilla color scheme.

- Increase logo from 28x28 to 32x32 pixels

### Phase 2: GameMechanics Registry

### Phase 3: HomePageLayoutManager

### Phase 4: Guide Buttons Two Columns
- Make guide/lore buttons half-size in two-column layout

### Phase 5: Survival Manual Wide Button
- Full-width button at top of home page

### Phase 6: Game Mechanics Button
- Centered button with phoenix icon and darker blue

### Phase 7: Survival Manual Content Converter
- Parse MD into collapsible structure with TOC per Part

### Phase 8: Game Mechanics Page Listing
- Create listing page for registered game mechanics

# Part 1: Before You Choke (First 5 Minutes)

## Congratulations On Being A Stationeer!

You've accepted the challenge.Earth needs passionate survivors who will venture out into the dark abyss to create civilization from moon dust. You have self-selected as an adventurer willing to take on unbelievable risks and forge your own path. All of civilization is relying on you to make the future plentiful and prosperous. You're a pioneer. You're a scientist. You're an engineer.

You're a Stationeer.

You're....standing on an alien world. There's a lander nearby with crates attached. You're already wearing a spacesuit and holding duct tape. Congratulations. Welcome to the cold loneliness of extraterrestrial exploration. Unless you have friends....Good for you.

**Don't panic. Take a breath (in real life - your character is breathing just fine from their suit - for now).**

Look around with your mouse. You'll see:
- **Your body** - You're in first person by default. Your suit is keeping you alive. If you don't work fast now eventually it'll suffocate you when you run out of air.
- **The lander** - A structure with several crates bolted to it. Everything you need is here.
- **The terrain** - Rock, dust, maybe some ice/ore deposits. This is home now.

### The Clock is Ticking - But You Have Time

Your suit has limited oxygen, limited battery power, and limited filter life. But here's the good news: **you have time**. Don't panic and rush. Mistakes from rushing kill more beginners than running out of air.

You have roughly 60 minutes of suit supplies if you do nothing. That's plenty of time to get oriented if you stay calm and move efficiently.

## What You're Already Wearing

Unlike many survival games, you don't spawn naked. You're already fully equipped:

### On Your Body

**Helmet** (Press 1) - On your head, keeping good air in and bad air out. It is locked to begin with (red button)

**EVA Suit** (Press 3) - Contains:
- Air canister (5700 kPa of oxygen - your breathing supply)
- Waste canister (collects filtered CO2)
- Large battery cell (powers suit functions)
- 3 CO2 filters (already installed, scrubbing your exhaled air)

**Jetpack** (Press 4) - On your back, contains:
- Propellant canister
- Medical pill (Will heal you up to 50% if you damage your organs)

## Basic Controls

Before we go further, learn these essential controls:

### Movement & Looking
- **WASD** - Move
- **Mouse** - Look around
- **Spacebar** - Jump
- **Shift** (hold) - Run

### Hands & Items
- **E** - Swap active hand (you have two hands, left and right)
- **Left Click** - Use/interact with what's in your active hand
- **Right Click** - Enter placement mode (for building)
- **F** - Swap held item with item in inventory slot
- **Q** - Drop held item (hold Q to throw it)
- **R** - Open item in hand, or access its options like splitting if its ore
- **G** - Auto-place held item in a random free inventory slot

### Inventory & Equipment
- **1-6 keys** - Open menus for worn items:
  - 1 = Helmet
  - 2 = Glasses
  - 3 = Suit (important! this is your life support controls)
  - 4 = Backpack/Jetpack
  - 5 = Uniform/Belt
  - 6 = Toolbelt
- **Hold Alt** - Enables mouse cursor for dragging items in inventory windows
- You have two control schema. One is hold alt and open things, the other is using the scroll wheel to choose options/items and hitting "F" to activate or move them.

### Other Important Keys
- **F1** - Open Stationpedia (in-game encyclopedia)
- **F2** - Special Stationpedia Ascended feature: Station Notepad! Takes notes on your plans.
- **I** - Quick-open helmet (DANGER: don't do this in vacuum!) disabled right now since your helmet is locked. You can unlock it by clicking the button in the helmet menu.
- **J** - Toggle jetpack on/off
- **L** - Toggle suit light on and off
- **C** - Auto-rotate when placing cables/pipes


### The "Alt + Mouse" System

Stationeers inventory works differently than most games. When you have an inventory window open:
1. **Hold Alt** to get a mouse cursor
2. **Click and drag** items to move them between slots
3. Release Alt when done

This takes getting used to, but it's how you'll manage all your equipment.

## Understanding Your Suit

Your suit is keeping you alive. Press **3** to open your suit panel and see your life support controls.

### What You'll See

The suit panel shows:
- **A/C** - Air conditioning (heating/cooling). Uses battery power. Your suit uses oxygen from you tank to cool you by sending it to the waste tank. 
- **Filter** - Toggle your CO2 filters on/off (leave ON)
- **Air** - Toggle air supply from your tank (leave ON)
- **Pressure** - Your target suit pressure (default is fine, but save oxygen by lowering it to target 30 kpa)
- **Temperature** - Your target temperature (default is fine but save energy by lowering it down as low as 5c, if there is no freezing warning it saves energy)

### How Breathing Works

The system is a cycle:

```
Oxygen Tank → Suit Atmosphere → You Breathe → Exhale CO2 → Filters Scrub CO2 → CO2 & some O2 Goes to Waste Tank
```

1. Your **air canister** (in your suit) feeds oxygen into your suit's internal atmosphere
2. You breathe this atmosphere
3. You exhale **carbon dioxide** (CO2)
4. Your **3 CO2 filters** remove the CO2 from your suit atmosphere
5. The filtered CO2 goes into your **waste canister**
6. The cycle continues

### When Things Go Wrong

**Waste tank full (above 4052 kPa):**
Your filters stop working. CO2 builds up. You suffocate even with oxygen left.
- **Fix:** Open your waste canister to vent it (we'll cover this below)

**Air tank empty:**
No new oxygen entering suit. You suffocate when suit atmosphere depletes.
- **Fix:** Connect to oxygen source or swap tanks - There is a White Portable Tank in your lander, that contains breathable atmosphere to refill your suit oxygen tank

**Filters worn out:**
Filters have a lifespan (small = 2 hours, medium = 10 hours). When depleted, CO2 builds up.
- **Fix:** Swap filters from your supplies

**Suit damaged:**
Pressure leaks. Atmosphere escapes.
- **Fix:** Use duct tape (you're holding some!) to repair(Hold duct tape in your hands, and hold down the right mouse button)

### How to Vent Your Waste Tank

When your waste tank gets too full:
1. Press **3** to open suit panel
2. Look for your waste canister
3. Click on it
4. Select **Open** to vent the CO2

On Moon (vacuum), this just releases CO2 to space. On Mars, it releases to the atmosphere. Either way, it's safe. Best though to release it indoors so you keep the CO2 in your base for early hydroponics - plants need CO2 and the amount released is usually negligable.

## Checking Your Status

### The HUD

Look at your screen. Several indicators show your status:

**Bottom central area** - Your two hands are shown. Your active hand is highlighted.

**Bottom right area** - Suit readouts appear here when helmet is on.

**Left of your character portrait** - Status icons appear here:
- Helmet icon (locked/unlocked)
- Pressure warnings
- Temperature warnings
- Oxygen warnings
- Suit damage indicators
- Hunger
- Thirst
- If you have taken health damage you will see a yellow or red player icon representing damage to "health" or that one of your organs is damaged.

### Warning Colors

### "Cognition" Warnings

If you see cognition warnings, something is very wrong with your atmosphere and you're about to pass out (and probably die). Check your oxygen, filters, and waste tank immediately. Run to safety.

### Checking External Conditions

Your HUD shows external temperature & pressure in the bottom right. This tells you how hostile the environment is.

For more detailed atmospheric readings, use the **tablet** in your jetpack. One of the crates in your lander has an atmospheric analyzer cartridge you can install to get a readout of atmospheric conditions and composition.

## Your First Priority

You're equipped. You know the controls. You've seen your supplies. Now what?

Your immediate needs in order:
1. **Shelter** - A sealed room protects you from the environment
2. **Power** - Everything needs power to run
3. **Air** - A pressurized room means you can take off your helmet
4. **Temperature** - Too hot or cold and you'll die even with air
5. **Water & Food** - You'll starve eventually

The next section covers building your first shelter.

## Summary: Your First 5 Minutes

You should now:
- Understand you're already equipped and safe (for now)
- Know the basic controls (especially 1-6 for equipment, Alt+mouse for inventory)
- Understand your suit's breathing system (tank → filters → waste tank)
- Know how to check your status and read warnings
- Know what's in your lander crates

**Don't rush. Don't panic. You have time.**

In Part 2, we'll build walls, set up an airlock, and create a pressurized room where you can finally take that helmet off.

# Part 2: Shelter (Minutes 5-20)

---

## Why You Need Walls

You're standing on an alien world. The environment outside is trying to kill you (don't worry, it's not personal):

- **Moon:** Vacuum - no atmosphere. It cold.
- **Mars:** Unbreathable CO2 atmosphere, temperature swings, dust storms after day 7

Your suit protects you for now, but it has limited supplies. A sealed shelter gives you:
- A stable atmosphere you can breathe without consuming suit oxygen
- Protection from temperature extremes
- A safe zone to remove your helmet and eat/drink
- A place to set up equipment that needs atmosphere

**Your first goal is a sealed room with a door.**

---

## Planning Your First Base

### Location

Find a **relatively flat area near your lander, or if you're adventurous the best view nearby**. Consider:
- Away from hills that might block sunlight for solar panels
- Close enough to your supply crates for easy access
- Enough space to expand later

### Size Recommendations

Start small. A 3x3 or 4x4 room is enough for your first shelter.

**Important:** Rooms have a maximum size of **1200 cubes**. Larger rooms won't pressurize properly. For a beginner, this won't be an issue - just don't try to enclose a massive area.

### What You'll Build

1. A floor (optional but recommended)
2. Four walls
3. A door
4. Later: an airlock system to prevent losing atmosphere

---

## Understanding the Grid System

Stationeers uses a grid-based building system. When you enter placement mode:
- Items snap to grid positions
- Some items go on the "large grid" (walls, frames)
- Some items go on the "small grid" (doors, consoles, vents, cables)
- The small grid sits on top of frames/floors

**Tip:** Watch the in-game tooltips when holding items. They show available placement positions and controls.

---

## Building Floors

Floors are optional but give you a surface for the small grid (cables, pipes, devices).

### What You Need
- **Iron Frames** (30 in your starter crate)
- **Iron Sheets** (50 in your starter crate)
- **Welder** (in your toolbelt)

### Steps

1. **Get an Iron Frame** from your crate
   - Use your wrench to detach the crate if needed
   - Open the crate and take Iron Frames

2. **Enter placement mode**
   - Hold the Iron Frame in your active hand
   - Press **Right-click** to enter placement mode
   - You'll see a ghost outline of where the frame will go

3. **Place the frame**
   - Move around to position it where you want
   - Check the in-game tooltips for rotation controls if needed
   - **Left-click** to place

4. **Complete the floor** (make it walkable)
   - Equip your **Welder** in your active hand (press 6 for toolbelt, grab welder)
   - Put **Iron Sheets** in your other hand
   - Turn on the welder by pressing **O** (the letter, not zero)
   - **IMPORTANT: The welder will keep emitting toxic gases, heat, and use its fuel if you don't turn it off. Turn it off between uses, especially if in a shelter atmosphere!
   - Point at the placed frame and hold left-click to weld
   - Uses 2 Iron Sheets per frame section

5. **Repeat** for your entire floor area

**Note:** Welded frames are walkable platforms but NOT airtight until welded to their final 2/2 welding state. To make airtight floors, you'd add 2 iron sheets total. Iron frames aren't pretty, but they are strong and can essentially hold unlimited pressure. Walls cannot hold unlimited pressure, you can see their limits in the stationpedia.
---

## Building Walls

Walls create the airtight barrier around your base.

### What You Need
- **Kit (Iron Wall)** - Called "Iron Wall Kits" (30 in your starter crate)
- **Iron Sheets** (you should have plenty left)

### Steps

1. **Get an Iron Wall Kit** from your crate

2. **Enter placement mode**
   - Right-click with the kit in hand
   - Position it at the edge of your floor area, standing vertically

3. **Place the wall frame**
   - Left-click to place
   - The wall frame appears but isn't complete yet

4. **Complete the wall**
   - Take an **Iron Sheet** in your hand
   - Point at the wall frame
   - Left-click to attach the sheet
   - No tools needed for this step - it just snaps on, some walls need tools which the tooltips tell you as long as you are holding a tool.

5. **Repeat** around your entire perimeter
   - Leave ONE gap for your door

### Wall Stats
- Completed iron walls can withstand **200 kPa** pressure differential
- This is plenty for a normal atmosphere (about 101 kPa inside vs vacuum outside)

---

## Building a Door

Your starter kit includes 2 **Door Kits**. These can become several door types - we'll build a **Composite Door** which is the standard powered door.

### What You Need
- **Kit (Door)** (2 in Construction Supplies 2 crate)
- **Plastic Sheet** (1 per door)
- **Glass Sheet** (1 per door)
- **Welder** (in toolbelt)
- **Crowbar** (in toolbelt)

### Steps

1. **Place the Door Kit**
   - Take the Door Kit in hand
   - Right-click to enter placement mode
   - Position in the gap you left in your walls
   - Left-click to place
   - Consider placing the doors with their power/data connectors facing inward to the airlock. So the doors are facing each other

2. **First construction stage**
   - Equip your **Welder** in active hand
   - Put a **Plastic Sheet** in your other hand
   - Turn on welder (press **O**)
   - Point at the door frame and left-click/hold to weld
   - **Turn off welder when done! (O)**

3. **Second construction stage**
   - Equip your **Crowbar** in active hand
   - Put a **Glass Sheet** in your other hand
   - Point at the door and left-click to complete it

4. **Door complete!**
   - The door now requires **10 Watts** of power to operate
   - Without power, you can still open it manually (see below)

---

## Manual Door Operation

When your door has no power (which it won't at first), you can still use it:

1. Walk up to the door
2. Equip your **Crowbar**
3. Left-click on the door to force it open/closed

**The problem:** Every time you open the door, your precious atmosphere escapes. On the Moon, it goes straight to vacuum. This is why you'll want an automated airlock - but first, let's check if your room is even sealed.

---

## Checking for a Seal

Before pressurizing, verify your room is actually airtight.

### Using the Tablet

1. Open your **Jetpack** inventory (press **4**)
2. Find your **Tablet** (Handheld Tablet)
3. It should have an **Atmospheric Analyzer Cartridge** installed

### Reading the Analyzer

With the tablet in hand, activate it and check the reading:

- **Shows "World"** = Your room is NOT sealed. There's a gap somewhere.
- **Shows a room number** (like "Room 1") = Your room IS sealed. You're ready to pressurize.

### Finding Leaks

If it shows "World," check:
- Every wall section - make sure all have Iron Sheets attached
- The corners - walls need to connect properly
- The door - is it fully constructed?


Walk around inside with the tablet active. Sometimes the leak is just one missing piece.

---

## Setting Up Power (Basic)

Before your door can operate automatically, you need power. For now, let's do the simplest setup:

### Quick Power for Your Door

1. **Find your Portable Solid Fuel Generator** (in the Electrical Supplies crate)
2. **Grab the Portable Sold Fuel Generator Box** Right click to unload the box
3. **Place it the portables connector** OUTSIDE your base
4. **Hold right click to deploy the Solid Fuel Generator**
5. **Grab the handle of the generator and drag it atop the connector**
6. **Grab your wrench and use it on the generator to connect it**
7. **Unpack the fuel canister and place it in the generator**
8. **Connect cables from the generator to the input of your APC**
9. **Turn on the generator**


**Note:** This is temporary. This generator will run out of fuel repeatedly. You can fill it from the fuel canister you took off the top of your lander. There is a slot to drop the canister in. You can use this for limited power for many days in game. Keep it outside so it doesn't poison you. You can always try to capture its output co2 and pollutants later though!
---

## The Airlock Problem

Now your door works with power. But there's still a problem:

**Every time you open the door, atmosphere in the airlock rushes out (assuming you closed the inner door before opening the outer....otherwise all your base air leaves).**

Even with an automated door, if you just walk through, you're losing air. The solution is an **airlock** - a chamber between two doors that you can depressurize to vacuum state or world atmos before opening the outer door.

Your starter kit includes everything for a basic automated airlock:
- 2 Door Kits (you used 1, have 1 left)
- Console Kit
- Circuitboard (Airlock) - the "Basic" airlock circuitboard
- Active Vent Kit
- Sensor Kits

---

## Manual Airlock (Simple Approach)

If automation seems overwhelming right now, you can run a manual airlock:

### Setup
1. Build a small chamber (2x1 is enough) attached to your base
2. Put a manual hatch door on each end instead of the composite doors - one to inside, one to outside
3. Put an **Active Vent** inside the chamber, connected to a pipe network a few segments long (don't use the passive vent though, it takes too long due to game mechanics)

### Manual Operation
1. Enter airlock from base, close inner door behind you
2. Set Active Vent to **Inward** (red) - this sucks air back into your base
3. Wait for pressure to drop to 0
4. Open outer door, exit 
5. When returning, do the reverse

**Downside:** This requires manually toggling the vent and waiting. It works, but gets tedious.

---

## Automated Airlock (Recommended)

The automated airlock handles the cycling for you with the press of a button.

### Components You'll Use
- **Console** with **Basic Airlock Circuitboard** inside (build it from the kit, then add circuit board, then add glass)
- **2 non-manual hatch Doors** (inner and outer)
- **Active Vent** (inside the airlock chamber)
- **Cables** connecting everything
- **Gas Sensor** for pressure monitoring
- **APC /w a battery** for making sure you don't get locked in/out of your airlock if you run out of power

### The Concept

The Basic Airlock Circuitboard, when installed in a Console, provides two buttons:
- **Cycle to Exterior** - Depressurizes the airlock and opens the outer door
- **Cycle to Interior** - Pressurizes the airlock and opens the inner door

It automatically:
- Locks all connected doors during cycling
- Controls the Active Vent to fill/empty the chamber
- Prevents both doors from being open at once
### Build your APC

The Area Power Controller or APC basically splits your power up into sub networks. It can recieve AND distribute "unlimited" power. The battery inside it will send maximum power out all at once if it is asked to, so make sure you don't need more than 5000watts if you're using standard cable. The area power controller has an input and an output. Make sure you hook the input side up to your solar panel/power generation and then hook your output up to the network that controls your airlock. The community standard is to have an APC in your airlock so if you lose power for some reason you can use a battery to power your airlock and still get into your base. The battery in the airlock also serves as a power store for longer periods of time (ie nighttime if you are using solar power and don't have large station batteries yet).

### Building the Console

1. **Place the Console Kit** on a wall inside your airlock chamber (or just outside)
   - Right-click to place, left-click to confirm

2. **Insert the Circuitboard**
   - Take the **Circuitboard (Airlock)** in hand
   - Left-click on the placed console kit to insert it

3. **Complete the console**
   - Take a **Glass Sheet** in hand
   - Left-click on the console to finish construction

4. The console needs **50 Watts** of power

### Building the Active Vent

1. **Place the Active Vent Kit** inside the airlock chamber
   - It goes on the small grid (on a floor/frame)
   - This needs pipe connections to your main atmosphere

2. Vent needs **100 Watts** of power

3. Connect cables from the vent to the same network as your console

### Connecting Everything with Cables

The key to automation: **all devices must be on the same cable network.**

1. Run cables connecting:
   - Console
   - Both doors
   - Active Vent
   - Your power source

2. Cables carry both **power** and **data** on the same wire

### Configuring the System

After wiring, you may need to reset the circuitboard:

1. Take your **Screwdriver** in hand

2. Left-click on the Console's screw

**Important:** The circuitboard automatically detects devices on the network. It designates:
- One door as "Interior Portal"
- One door as "Exterior Portal"
- The Active Vent for atmosphere control
- Both doors will say "exterior" in green. This means they aren't set. Hit the one you think or have named outside. Then hit the interior one. They both turn red text and green highlight meaning they are locked. 

If it picks the wrong door for interior/exterior, you may need to rewire or check the in-game Stationpedia for reassignment options. You can also use a label maker to name them which makes it easy to see which is which.

### Using the Automated Airlock

Once set up:

1. Approach the Console

2. Left-click to interact

3. Press **Cycle to Interior** or **Cycle to Exterior**

4. Wait for the cycle to complete

5. The appropriate door unlocks and opens

**Note:** When the circuitboard is powered, it **locks** all connected doors and vents. They cannot be manually operated. This is a safety feature.

---

## Power Requirements Summary

Your airlock system needs continuous power:
- Console: 50W
- Active Vent: 100W
- Each Door: 10W

**Total: ~170W minimum**

A single solar panel provides about 850W in direct sunlight on the moon, which is plenty during the day. At night, you'll need batteries - covered in Part 3.

---

## Pressurizing Your Base

Once your airlock is set up (or if you're using a manual system), you can fill your base with breathable atmosphere.

### Using Your Portable Oxygen Tank

Your lander has a **Portable Tank** attached with 7576 kPa of oxygen. DONT USE THIS TO FILL YOUR BASE YET. Go find some Oxite and bring it into your base.

### Quick Pressurization

1. Mine 2-3 stacks of Oxite

2. Carry it inside your sealed base

3. Take out your welder and start melting the ice

4. Wait for pressure to build

### How Much Pressure?

You need at least **20 kPa** partial pressure of oxygen to breathe comfortably.

Normal target: around **50-100 kPa** total pressure. Your suit targets 101.325 kPa by default (Earth sea level), but you can survive with less.

Use your tablet's atmospheric analyzer to monitor pressure inside.

## Summary: Your First Shelter

You should now have:
- A sealed room with walls and floor
- A door you can operate (manually or with power)
- Ideally, an airlock to prevent atmosphere loss
- Some atmosphere inside to breathe
- A Portable Generator powering your base with liquid fuel

**Don't take your helmet off yet!** We need to verify:
- Temperature is survivable (next part)
- Atmosphere is actually breathable (oxygen content)
- CO2 isn't building up

In Part 3, we'll cover:
- More Power systems (Solid Generator, Batteries, APC)
- Temperature control (not freezing to death)
- Proper atmospheric setup
- Managing your consumables

# Part 1: Before You Choke (First 5 Minutes)

## Congratulations On Being A Stationeer!

You've accepted the challenge.Earth needs passionate survivors who will venture out into the dark abyss to create civilization from moon dust. You have self-selected as an adventurer willing to take on unbelievable risks and forge your own path. All of civilization is relying on you to make the future plentiful and prosperous. You're a pioneer. You're a scientist. You're an engineer.

You're a Stationeer.

You're....standing on an alien world. There's a lander nearby with crates attached. You're already wearing a spacesuit and holding duct tape. Congratulations. Welcome to the cold loneliness of extraterrestrial exploration. Unless you have friends....Good for you.

**Don't panic. Take a breath (in real life - your character is breathing just fine from their suit - for now).**

Look around with your mouse. You'll see:
- **Your body** - You're in first person by default. Your suit is keeping you alive. If you don't work fast now eventually it'll suffocate you when you run out of air.
- **The lander** - A structure with several crates bolted to it. Everything you need is here.
- **The terrain** - Rock, dust, maybe some ice/ore deposits. This is home now.

### The Clock is Ticking - But You Have Time

Your suit has limited oxygen, limited battery power, and limited filter life. But here's the good news: **you have time**. Don't panic and rush. Mistakes from rushing kill more beginners than running out of air.

You have roughly 60 minutes of suit supplies if you do nothing. That's plenty of time to get oriented if you stay calm and move efficiently.

---

## What You're Already Wearing

Unlike many survival games, you don't spawn naked. You're already fully equipped:

### On Your Body

**Helmet** (Press 1) - On your head, keeping good air in and bad air out. It is locked to begin with (red button)

**EVA Suit** (Press 3) - Contains:
- Air canister (5700 kPa of oxygen - your breathing supply)
- Waste canister (collects filtered CO2)
- Large battery cell (powers suit functions)
- 3 CO2 filters (already installed, scrubbing your exhaled air)

**Jetpack** (Press 4) - On your back, contains:
- Propellant canister
- Medical pill (Will heal you up to 50% if you damage your organs)
- Handheld tablet (with atmospheric analyzer, network analyzer, tracker cartridges)
- Mining belt (with drill, pickaxe, 20 flares, portable solar panel)

**Orange Uniform** (Press 5) - Contains:
- Cereal Bar
- Water bottle
- Credit card (for traders later)

**Toolbelt** (Press 6) - Contains your tools:
- Wrench (rotate and adjust things)
- Crowbar (open unpowered doors, deconstruct)
- Hand drill
- Wire cutters
- Welder (with fuel - welds frames into walls. DON'T FORGET TO TURN IT OFF WHEN YOU AREN'T USING IT. IT WILL EXPLODE)
- Screwdriver (interact with electrical components)
- Angle grinder (cuts things)
- 50 cable coils

**In Your Hand** - Duct tape for repairing suit damage if you puncture or harm your suit through accidents or game bugs.

### You're Already Set Up

This is important: **you don't need to equip anything**. Your suit is working, your filters are filtering, your oxygen is flowing. You're safe for now.

---

## Basic Controls

Before we go further, learn these essential controls:

### Movement & Looking
- **WASD** - Move
- **Mouse** - Look around
- **Spacebar** - Jump
- **Shift** (hold) - Run

### Hands & Items
- **E** - Swap active hand (you have two hands, left and right)
- **Left Click** - Use/interact with what's in your active hand
- **Right Click** - Enter placement mode (for building)
- **F** - Swap held item with item in inventory slot
- **Q** - Drop held item (hold Q to throw it)
- **R** - Open item in hand, or access its options like splitting if its ore
- **G** - Auto-place held item in a random free inventory slot

### Inventory & Equipment
- **1-6 keys** - Open menus for worn items:
  - 1 = Helmet
  - 2 = Glasses
  - 3 = Suit (important! this is your life support controls)
  - 4 = Backpack/Jetpack
  - 5 = Uniform/Belt
  - 6 = Toolbelt
- **Hold Alt** - Enables mouse cursor for dragging items in inventory windows
- You have two control schema. One is hold alt and open things, the other is using the scroll wheel to choose options/items and hitting "F" to activate or move them.

### Other Important Keys
- **F1** - Open Stationpedia (in-game encyclopedia)
- **F2** - Special Stationpedia Ascended feature: Station Notepad! Takes notes on your plans.
- **I** - Quick-open helmet (DANGER: don't do this in vacuum!) disabled right now since your helmet is locked. You can unlock it by clicking the button in the helmet menu.
- **J** - Toggle jetpack on/off
- **L** - Toggle suit light on and off
- **C** - Auto-rotate when placing cables/pipes


### The "Alt + Mouse" System

Stationeers inventory works differently than most games. When you have an inventory window open:
1. **Hold Alt** to get a mouse cursor
2. **Click and drag** items to move them between slots
3. Release Alt when done

This takes getting used to, but it's how you'll manage all your equipment.

---

## Understanding Your Suit

Your suit is keeping you alive. Press **3** to open your suit panel and see your life support controls.

### What You'll See

The suit panel shows:
- **A/C** - Air conditioning (heating/cooling). Uses battery power. Your suit uses oxygen from you tank to cool you by sending it to the waste tank. 
- **Filter** - Toggle your CO2 filters on/off (leave ON)
- **Air** - Toggle air supply from your tank (leave ON)
- **Pressure** - Your target suit pressure (default is fine, but save oxygen by lowering it to target 30 kpa)
- **Temperature** - Your target temperature (default is fine but save energy by lowering it down as low as 5c, if there is no freezing warning it saves energy)

### How Breathing Works

The system is a cycle:

```
Oxygen Tank → Suit Atmosphere → You Breathe → Exhale CO2 → Filters Scrub CO2 → CO2 & some O2 Goes to Waste Tank
```

1. Your **air canister** (in your suit) feeds oxygen into your suit's internal atmosphere
2. You breathe this atmosphere
3. You exhale **carbon dioxide** (CO2)
4. Your **3 CO2 filters** remove the CO2 from your suit atmosphere
5. The filtered CO2 goes into your **waste canister**
6. The cycle continues

### When Things Go Wrong

**Waste tank full (above 4052 kPa):**
Your filters stop working. CO2 builds up. You suffocate even with oxygen left.
- **Fix:** Open your waste canister to vent it (we'll cover this below)

**Air tank empty:**
No new oxygen entering suit. You suffocate when suit atmosphere depletes.
- **Fix:** Connect to oxygen source or swap tanks - There is a White Portable Tank in your lander, that contains breathable atmosphere to refill your suit oxygen tank

**Filters worn out:**
Filters have a lifespan (small = 2 hours, medium = 10 hours). When depleted, CO2 builds up.
- **Fix:** Swap filters from your supplies

**Suit damaged:**
Pressure leaks. Atmosphere escapes.
- **Fix:** Use duct tape (you're holding some!) to repair(Hold duct tape in your hands, and hold down the right mouse button)

### How to Vent Your Waste Tank

When your waste tank gets too full:
1. Press **3** to open suit panel
2. Look for your waste canister
3. Click on it
4. Select **Open** to vent the CO2

On Moon (vacuum), this just releases CO2 to space. On Mars, it releases to the atmosphere. Either way, it's safe. Best though to release it indoors so you keep the CO2 in your base for early hydroponics - plants need CO2 and the amount released is usually negligable.

---

## Checking Your Status

### The HUD

Look at your screen. Several indicators show your status:

**Bottom central area** - Your two hands are shown. Your active hand is highlighted.

**Bottom right area** - Suit readouts appear here when helmet is on.

**Left of your character portrait** - Status icons appear here:
- Helmet icon (locked/unlocked)
- Pressure warnings
- Temperature warnings
- Oxygen warnings
- Suit damage indicators
- Hunger
- Thirst
- If you have taken health damage you will see a yellow or red player icon representing damage to "health" or that one of your organs is damaged.

### Warning Colors

### "Cognition" Warnings

If you see cognition warnings, something is very wrong with your atmosphere and you're about to pass out (and probably die). Check your oxygen, filters, and waste tank immediately. Run to safety.

### Checking External Conditions

Your HUD shows external temperature & pressure in the bottom right. This tells you how hostile the environment is.

For more detailed atmospheric readings, use the **tablet** in your jetpack. One of the crates in your lander has an atmospheric analyzer cartridge you can install to get a readout of atmospheric conditions and composition.

---

## The Lander and Your Supplies

Now let's look at what you have to work with.

### The Lander Structure

Walk over to your lander. It has:
- 5 various supply crates attached)
- 3 tank mounts (White one has a portable oxygen tank - 7576 kPa = 7.Mpa) 

### Detaching Crates

The crates are bolted to the lander. To remove one:
1. Equip your **wrench** from your toolbelt (press 6, then use Alt+mouse or F to swap to hand)
2. Click on the crate's attachment point
3. The crate detaches and can be moved

### What's In The Crates/Tanks

### Don't Leave Things on the Ground

**Important warning:** Items left on the ground can be blown away during a "storm" on most planets. Always put items back in crates or inside your base. Never dump things on the ground and walk away.

---

## Your First Priority

You're equipped. You know the controls. You've seen your supplies. Now what?

Your immediate needs in order:
1. **Shelter** - A sealed room protects you from the environment
2. **Power** - Everything needs power to run
3. **Air** - A pressurized room means you can take off your helmet
4. **Temperature** - Too hot or cold and you'll die even with air
5. **Water & Food** - You'll starve eventually

The next section covers building your first shelter.

---

## Summary: Your First 5 Minutes

You should now:
- Understand you're already equipped and safe (for now)
- Know the basic controls (especially 1-6 for equipment, Alt+mouse for inventory)
- Understand your suit's breathing system (tank → filters → waste tank)
- Know how to check your status and read warnings
- Know what's in your lander crates

**Don't rush. Don't panic. You have time.**

In Part 2, we'll build walls, set up an airlock, and create a pressurized room where you can finally take that helmet off.

---

*Next: Part 2 - Shelter (Minutes 5-20)*

---

# Part 2: Shelter (Minutes 5-20)

---

## Why You Need Walls

You're standing on an alien world. The environment outside is trying to kill you (don't worry, it's not personal):

- **Moon:** Vacuum - no atmosphere. It cold.
- **Mars:** Unbreathable CO2 atmosphere, temperature swings, dust storms after day 7

Your suit protects you for now, but it has limited supplies. A sealed shelter gives you:
- A stable atmosphere you can breathe without consuming suit oxygen
- Protection from temperature extremes
- A safe zone to remove your helmet and eat/drink
- A place to set up equipment that needs atmosphere

**Your first goal is a sealed room with a door.**

---

## Planning Your First Base

### Location

Find a **relatively flat area near your lander, or if you're adventurous the best view nearby**. Consider:
- Away from hills that might block sunlight for solar panels
- Close enough to your supply crates for easy access
- Enough space to expand later

### Size Recommendations

Start small. A 3x3 or 4x4 room is enough for your first shelter.

**Important:** Rooms have a maximum size of **1200 cubes**. Larger rooms won't pressurize properly. For a beginner, this won't be an issue - just don't try to enclose a massive area.

### What You'll Build

1. A floor (optional but recommended)
2. Four walls
3. A door
4. Later: an airlock system to prevent losing atmosphere

---

## Understanding the Grid System

Stationeers uses a grid-based building system. When you enter placement mode:
- Items snap to grid positions
- Some items go on the "large grid" (walls, frames)
- Some items go on the "small grid" (doors, consoles, vents, cables)
- The small grid sits on top of frames/floors

**Tip:** Watch the in-game tooltips when holding items. They show available placement positions and controls.

---

## Building Floors

Floors are optional but give you a surface for the small grid (cables, pipes, devices).

### What You Need
- **Iron Frames** (30 in your starter crate)
- **Iron Sheets** (50 in your starter crate)
- **Welder** (in your toolbelt)

### Steps

1. **Get an Iron Frame** from your crate
   - Use your wrench to detach the crate if needed
   - Open the crate and take Iron Frames

2. **Enter placement mode**
   - Hold the Iron Frame in your active hand
   - Press **Right-click** to enter placement mode
   - You'll see a ghost outline of where the frame will go

3. **Place the frame**
   - Move around to position it where you want
   - Check the in-game tooltips for rotation controls if needed
   - **Left-click** to place

4. **Complete the floor** (make it walkable)
   - Equip your **Welder** in your active hand (press 6 for toolbelt, grab welder)
   - Put **Iron Sheets** in your other hand
   - Turn on the welder by pressing **O** (the letter, not zero)
   - **IMPORTANT: The welder will keep emitting toxic gases, heat, and use its fuel if you don't turn it off. Turn it off between uses, especially if in a shelter atmosphere!
   - Point at the placed frame and hold left-click to weld
   - Uses 2 Iron Sheets per frame section

5. **Repeat** for your entire floor area

**Note:** Welded frames are walkable platforms but NOT airtight until welded to their final 2/2 welding state. To make airtight floors, you'd add 2 iron sheets total. Iron frames aren't pretty, but they are strong and can essentially hold unlimited pressure. Walls cannot hold unlimited pressure, you can see their limits in the stationpedia.
---

## Building Walls

Walls create the airtight barrier around your base.

### What You Need
- **Kit (Iron Wall)** - Called "Iron Wall Kits" (30 in your starter crate)
- **Iron Sheets** (you should have plenty left)

### Steps

1. **Get an Iron Wall Kit** from your crate

2. **Enter placement mode**
   - Right-click with the kit in hand
   - Position it at the edge of your floor area, standing vertically

3. **Place the wall frame**
   - Left-click to place
   - The wall frame appears but isn't complete yet

4. **Complete the wall**
   - Take an **Iron Sheet** in your hand
   - Point at the wall frame
   - Left-click to attach the sheet
   - No tools needed for this step - it just snaps on, some walls need tools which the tooltips tell you as long as you are holding a tool.

5. **Repeat** around your entire perimeter
   - Leave ONE gap for your door

### Wall Stats
- Completed iron walls can withstand **200 kPa** pressure differential
- This is plenty for a normal atmosphere (about 101 kPa inside vs vacuum outside)

---

## Building a Door

Your starter kit includes 2 **Door Kits**. These can become several door types - we'll build a **Composite Door** which is the standard powered door.

### What You Need
- **Kit (Door)** (2 in Construction Supplies 2 crate)
- **Plastic Sheet** (1 per door)
- **Glass Sheet** (1 per door)
- **Welder** (in toolbelt)
- **Crowbar** (in toolbelt)

### Steps

1. **Place the Door Kit**
   - Take the Door Kit in hand
   - Right-click to enter placement mode
   - Position in the gap you left in your walls
   - Left-click to place
   - Consider placing the doors with their power/data connectors facing inward to the airlock. So the doors are facing each other

2. **First construction stage**
   - Equip your **Welder** in active hand
   - Put a **Plastic Sheet** in your other hand
   - Turn on welder (press **O**)
   - Point at the door frame and left-click/hold to weld
   - **Turn off welder when done! (O)**

3. **Second construction stage**
   - Equip your **Crowbar** in active hand
   - Put a **Glass Sheet** in your other hand
   - Point at the door and left-click to complete it

4. **Door complete!**
   - The door now requires **10 Watts** of power to operate
   - Without power, you can still open it manually (see below)

---

## Manual Door Operation

When your door has no power (which it won't at first), you can still use it:

1. Walk up to the door
2. Equip your **Crowbar**
3. Left-click on the door to force it open/closed

**The problem:** Every time you open the door, your precious atmosphere escapes. On the Moon, it goes straight to vacuum. This is why you'll want an automated airlock - but first, let's check if your room is even sealed.

---

## Checking for a Seal

Before pressurizing, verify your room is actually airtight.

### Using the Tablet

1. Open your **Jetpack** inventory (press **4**)
2. Find your **Tablet** (Handheld Tablet)
3. It should have an **Atmospheric Analyzer Cartridge** installed

### Reading the Analyzer

With the tablet in hand, activate it and check the reading:

- **Shows "World"** = Your room is NOT sealed. There's a gap somewhere.
- **Shows a room number** (like "Room 1") = Your room IS sealed. You're ready to pressurize.

### Finding Leaks

If it shows "World," check:
- Every wall section - make sure all have Iron Sheets attached
- The corners - walls need to connect properly
- The door - is it fully constructed?


Walk around inside with the tablet active. Sometimes the leak is just one missing piece.

---

## Setting Up Power (Basic)

Before your door can operate automatically, you need power. For now, let's do the simplest setup:

### Quick Power for Your Door

1. **Find your Portable Solid Fuel Generator** (in the Electrical Supplies crate)
2. **Grab the Portable Sold Fuel Generator Box** Right click to unload the box
3. **Place it the portables connector** OUTSIDE your base
4. **Hold right click to deploy the Solid Fuel Generator**
5. **Grab the handle of the generator and drag it atop the connector**
6. **Grab your wrench and use it on the generator to connect it**
7. **Unpack the fuel canister and place it in the generator**
8. **Connect cables from the generator to the input of your APC**
9. **Turn on the generator**


**Note:** This is temporary. This generator will run out of fuel repeatedly. You can fill it from the fuel canister you took off the top of your lander. There is a slot to drop the canister in. You can use this for limited power for many days in game. Keep it outside so it doesn't poison you. You can always try to capture its output co2 and pollutants later though!
---

## The Airlock Problem

Now your door works with power. But there's still a problem:

**Every time you open the door, atmosphere in the airlock rushes out (assuming you closed the inner door before opening the outer....otherwise all your base air leaves).**

Even with an automated door, if you just walk through, you're losing air. The solution is an **airlock** - a chamber between two doors that you can depressurize to vacuum state or world atmos before opening the outer door.

Your starter kit includes everything for a basic automated airlock:
- 2 Door Kits (you used 1, have 1 left)
- Console Kit
- Circuitboard (Airlock) - the "Basic" airlock circuitboard
- Active Vent Kit
- Sensor Kits

---

## Manual Airlock (Simple Approach)

If automation seems overwhelming right now, you can run a manual airlock:

### Setup
1. Build a small chamber (2x1 is enough) attached to your base
2. Put a manual hatch door on each end instead of the composite doors - one to inside, one to outside
3. Put an **Active Vent** inside the chamber, connected to a pipe network a few segments long (don't use the passive vent though, it takes too long due to game mechanics)

### Manual Operation
1. Enter airlock from base, close inner door behind you
2. Set Active Vent to **Inward** (red) - this sucks air back into your base
3. Wait for pressure to drop to 0
4. Open outer door, exit 
5. When returning, do the reverse

**Downside:** This requires manually toggling the vent and waiting. It works, but gets tedious.

---

## Automated Airlock (Recommended)

The automated airlock handles the cycling for you with the press of a button.

### Components You'll Use
- **Console** with **Basic Airlock Circuitboard** inside (build it from the kit, then add circuit board, then add glass)
- **2 non-manual hatch Doors** (inner and outer)
- **Active Vent** (inside the airlock chamber)
- **Cables** connecting everything
- **Gas Sensor** for pressure monitoring
- **APC /w a battery** for making sure you don't get locked in/out of your airlock if you run out of power

### The Concept

The Basic Airlock Circuitboard, when installed in a Console, provides two buttons:
- **Cycle to Exterior** - Depressurizes the airlock and opens the outer door
- **Cycle to Interior** - Pressurizes the airlock and opens the inner door

It automatically:
- Locks all connected doors during cycling
- Controls the Active Vent to fill/empty the chamber
- Prevents both doors from being open at once
### Build your APC

The Area Power Controller or APC basically splits your power up into sub networks. It can recieve AND distribute "unlimited" power. The battery inside it will send maximum power out all at once if it is asked to, so make sure you don't need more than 5000watts if you're using standard cable. The area power controller has an input and an output. Make sure you hook the input side up to your solar panel/power generation and then hook your output up to the network that controls your airlock. The community standard is to have an APC in your airlock so if you lose power for some reason you can use a battery to power your airlock and still get into your base. The battery in the airlock also serves as a power store for longer periods of time (ie nighttime if you are using solar power and don't have large station batteries yet).

### Building the Console

1. **Place the Console Kit** on a wall inside your airlock chamber (or just outside)
   - Right-click to place, left-click to confirm

2. **Insert the Circuitboard**
   - Take the **Circuitboard (Airlock)** in hand
   - Left-click on the placed console kit to insert it

3. **Complete the console**
   - Take a **Glass Sheet** in hand
   - Left-click on the console to finish construction

4. The console needs **50 Watts** of power

### Building the Active Vent

1. **Place the Active Vent Kit** inside the airlock chamber
   - It goes on the small grid (on a floor/frame)
   - This needs pipe connections to your main atmosphere

2. Vent needs **100 Watts** of power

3. Connect cables from the vent to the same network as your console

### Connecting Everything with Cables

The key to automation: **all devices must be on the same cable network.**

1. Run cables connecting:
   - Console
   - Both doors
   - Active Vent
   - Your power source

2. Cables carry both **power** and **data** on the same wire

### Configuring the System

After wiring, you may need to reset the circuitboard:

1. Take your **Screwdriver** in hand

2. Left-click on the Console's screw

**Important:** The circuitboard automatically detects devices on the network. It designates:
- One door as "Interior Portal"
- One door as "Exterior Portal"
- The Active Vent for atmosphere control
- Both doors will say "exterior" in green. This means they aren't set. Hit the one you think or have named outside. Then hit the interior one. They both turn red text and green highlight meaning they are locked. 

If it picks the wrong door for interior/exterior, you may need to rewire or check the in-game Stationpedia for reassignment options. You can also use a label maker to name them which makes it easy to see which is which.

### Using the Automated Airlock

Once set up:

1. Approach the Console

2. Left-click to interact

3. Press **Cycle to Interior** or **Cycle to Exterior**

4. Wait for the cycle to complete

5. The appropriate door unlocks and opens

**Note:** When the circuitboard is powered, it **locks** all connected doors and vents. They cannot be manually operated. This is a safety feature.

---

## Power Requirements Summary

Your airlock system needs continuous power:
- Console: 50W
- Active Vent: 100W
- Each Door: 10W

**Total: ~170W minimum**

A single solar panel provides about 850W in direct sunlight on the moon, which is plenty during the day. At night, you'll need batteries - covered in Part 3.

---

## Pressurizing Your Base

Once your airlock is set up (or if you're using a manual system), you can fill your base with breathable atmosphere.

### Using Your Portable Oxygen Tank

Your lander has a **Portable Tank** attached with 7576 kPa of oxygen. DONT USE THIS TO FILL YOUR BASE YET. Go find some Oxite and bring it into your base.

### Quick Pressurization

1. Mine 2-3 stacks of Oxite

2. Carry it inside your sealed base

3. Take out your welder and start melting the ice

4. Wait for pressure to build

### How Much Pressure?

You need at least **20 kPa** partial pressure of oxygen to breathe comfortably.

Normal target: around **50-100 kPa** total pressure. Your suit targets 101.325 kPa by default (Earth sea level), but you can survive with less.

Use your tablet's atmospheric analyzer to monitor pressure inside.

---

## Summary: Your First Shelter

You should now have:
- A sealed room with walls and floor
- A door you can operate (manually or with power)
- Ideally, an airlock to prevent atmosphere loss
- Some atmosphere inside to breathe
- A Portable Generator powering your base with liquid fuel

**Don't take your helmet off yet!** We need to verify:
- Temperature is survivable (next part)
- Atmosphere is actually breathable (oxygen content)
- CO2 isn't building up

In Part 3, we'll cover:
- More Power systems (Solid Generator, Batteries, APC)
- Temperature control (not freezing to death)
- Proper atmospheric setup
- Managing your consumables

---

*Next: Part 3 - Not Dying Tonight (Power, Temperature, and Atmosphere)*

---

# Part 3: Not Dying Tonight (Power, Temperature, and Atmosphere)

---

## The Three Killers

You have a sealed shelter. Now you need to survive inside it. Three things will kill you if you get them wrong:

1. **No Power** - Your doors won't open, your equipment won't run
2. **Wrong Temperature** - Too hot or cold and you'll take damage
3. **Bad Atmosphere** - Wrong pressure, wrong gases, or no oxygen

Let's solve each one.

---

## Power Systems

Everything in your base needs electricity. No power = no survival.

### Understanding Power Basics

**Cables carry electricity:**
- **Regular Cable** - Handles up to **5,000 Watts (5kW)**
- **Heavy Cable** - Handles up to **100,000 Watts (100kW)**

If you pull more power than a cable can handle, **the cable burns out**. This is a common beginner mistake. We recommend setting up your power structure like this:

Power Source (generator, solar)-->Transformer-->Battery-->APC-->Transformer-->Fuse-->Network. Please see the "Power" guide for more detail.69

**Your starter kit uses regular cable coils (50 in your toolbelt).** This means your entire early base is limited to 5kW total unless you make heavy cables later.

### Solar Panels

Your most automatable and simple power source. One **Kit (Solar Panel Basic)** is in your starter crate. This is the basic solar panel that can't adjust to the angle of the sun. You can plop it down on a frame and hook it up to your power distribution network. It isn't much good until you have a station battery to store all the power. If you want more advanced solar panels & batteries you'll have to learn advanced smelting and build the regular solar panels/station batteries. There are other guides in Stationpedia Ascended's database to instruct you in that direction. For reference below:69

**Building a Solar Panel:**
1. Place the Kit (Solar Panel) on a large grid outside
2. Add a **Glass Sheet** to complete it
3. Connect cables from the panel to your power grid


**Power Output:**
- **Moon:** Up to 750W in direct sunlight
- **Mars:** Up to 455W in direct sunlight
- **Output depends on angle** - panels facing the sun directly produce more

### Station Batteries

Batteries store power for when your solar panels aren't producing.

**Building a Station Battery:**
The Kit (Station Battery) requires crafting - it's NOT in your starter kit. You'll need:
- Electronics Printer or Fabricator (requires Autolathe first)
- 20g Gold, 20g Copper, 20g Steel - see the Smelting Mechanics Page69

**Once you have the kit:**
1. Place it on a large grid
2. Use **Welder + 2 Steel Sheets** to build stage 1
3. Use **Screwdriver** to complete it
 
**Capacity:** 3.6 MJ (1 kWh) - enough to run basic systems overnight

**How it works:**
- Connects to your cable network via input and output ports
- Charges when excess power is available
- Discharges when power is needed


### The Solid Fuel Generator (Starter Kit Option)

Your starter kit includes a **Kit (Solid Generator)**. This burns fuel to produce power - useful for night or emergencies. Try to either build a Station Battery before you build this so you can store the power you make.

**Building:**
1. Place the kit on a frame
2. Connect to your power network with cables

**Fuel Types:**
- **Coal** - 200 kJ per unit, burns 5 seconds
- **Charcoal** - 120 kJ per unit, burns 3 seconds minimum
- **Solid Fuel** - 400 kJ per unit, burns 10 seconds

**Power Output:** Up to **20kW** (but requires heavy cables for full output; regular cables limit you to 5kW)

**Getting Fuel:**
- Coal: Mine it from ore deposits (use Mining Drill or Pickaxe)
- You'll want an **Ore Scanner Cartridge** in your tablet which you have to build. 

### Battery Charger

Your starter kit includes a **Battery Charger**. This charges the small battery cells used in your suit, tablet, and portable devices.

**Setup:**
1. Place on a wall
2. Connect to power network
3. Insert battery cells (holds up to 5)

**Power Draw:**
- 10W standby
- 500W per battery being charged
- Maximum 2,500W if charging 5 batteries

**Charging Times:**
- Small Battery Cell: ~36 seconds
- Large Battery Cell: ~4 minutes 48 seconds

## Temperature Control

Your body needs to stay within a safe temperature range.

### Safe Temperature Range

- **Safe:** 0°C to 50°C (273K to 323K)
- **Yellow Warning:** Below 0°C or approaching limits
- **Red Warning / Damage:** Below -10°C or above 50°C

**On the Moon:** External temperature doesn't really exist although the sun shining through windows will heat your base
**On Mars:** Temp can swing between -13c and 5c swings, plus storms can affect temperature

### Portable Air Conditioner (Starter Kit)

Your starter kit includes a **Kit (Portable Air Conditioner)**. This is your first temperature control option.

**How it works:**
- **Cold Mode:** Removes heat from the room, stores it internally
- **Hot Mode:** Releases stored heat into the room

**Power:** 200W (uses battery cells)
- Small Battery: ~1.5 minutes
- Large Battery: ~12 minutes

**Limitations:**
- Cold mode stops working if room exceeds +30°C
- Hot mode stops working if room drops below -10°C
- Internal tank fills up - when it flashes an error, you need to dump the stored heat/cold

**Using it:**
1. Build the kit (place it)
2. Insert a battery cell
3. Set to Cold or Hot mode as needed
4. When tank fills, either:
   - Vent to outside (if you can tolerate the temperature there)
   - Connect to a Tank Connector with wrench to dump into pipes

**For beginners:** This is temporary. It will keep a small room habitable while you set up better systems. BE CAREFUL. THE COOLANT TANK IS FILLED WITH N20 AND WILL EXPLODE IF IT GETS TOO HOT KILLING YOU AND DESTROYING YOUR BASE

### Heating Up

At the beginning, you can build a wall heater described below, or just pop some windows into you base using the Wall Kit. Windows let the sun shine in and will heat your base atmos, so all you will need is to cool the base, never heat it. Printers and another machines also generate heat when operating/turned on.

#Wall Heater

**Requires crafting** with Hydraulic Pipe Bender:
- 3g Iron, 1g Gold, 3g Copper

**Power:** 1010W (significant draw!)

**How it works:** Converts electricity directly into heat. Place on wall, connect power, turn on.

**Good for:** Moon bases where cold is the main problem.

### Wall Cooler

If your base is too hot, you may want a Wall Cooler. Most bases generate a fair amount of heat, so this is a critical step for early game. The Wall Cooler is not power efficient, however, and it is much better to simply use a digital valve with some radiators and a pipe to the outside atmosphere. On the moon & mars outside is cold enough to get your base down to 20c easily. See the Temperature & Base Guide for these techniques 69.

**Requires crafting** with Hydraulic Pipe Bender:
- 3g Iron, 1g Gold, 3g Copper

**Power:** 10W idle, 1000W when cooling

**How it works:** Removes heat from the room and dumps it into a coolant pipe. **You need a pipe network with gas to carry the heat away** - this makes it more complex than the heater.

**For beginners:** Use the Portable AC first. Wall Cooler setup requires using pipes etc. Once you have the portable air conditioner up you can set up wall heaters/coolers.

## Atmosphere Setup

You need breathable air at the right pressure and temperature.

### What You Need to Breathe

**Oxygen Partial Pressure:**
- **Minimum safe:** ~16 kPa oxygen partial pressure
- **Recommended:** ~20 kPa or higher (no warnings)
- **Warning thresholds:**
  - 16-12 kPa: Yellow "Oxygen Low" warning (no damage)
  - 12-5 kPa: Red "Oxygen Critical" warning (no damage yet)
  - Below 5 kPa: You're suffocating

**What is Partial Pressure?**
It's the portion of total pressure from one specific gas.

**Example:** If your room has 100 kPa total pressure and is 20% oxygen:
- Oxygen partial pressure = 100 × 0.20 = 20 kPa ✓ (breathable)

**Example:** If your room has 50 kPa total and is 20% oxygen:
- Oxygen partial pressure = 50 × 0.20 = 10 kPa ✗ (critical warning)

### Filling your Suit Oxygen Tank

Your lander has a **Portable Tank with 7576 kPa of pure oxygen**. You can use this directly. It's best though to use this tank to fill your suit oxygen tank until you can get a system up to sustainably to filter oxygen from other gases and put it in your suit tank. You can also use dirty air (oxygen, nitrogen etc.) in your suit tank if you apply the correct filters. An easy way to get more air in your tank is to use a canister filler with an active vent and suck in base air carefully until you fill the tank. For now, stick with using your Portable Oxygen Tank's canister slot to fill your oxygen tank.


### The Nitrogen/Oxygen Mix (Long-term)

You can save Oxygen by filling most of your base with Nitrogen if available.

**Recommended ratio:** Approximately **3:1 Nitrogen to Oxygen** (75% N2, 25% O2)

**At 100 kPa total pressure:**
- 75 kPa Nitrogen
- 25 kPa Oxygen (well above the 20 kPa minimum)

**Getting Nitrogen:**
- **Moon:** Mine Nitrogen Ice (Nitrice), melt in Arc Furnace
- **Mars:** The atmosphere is mostly CO2, but contains some nitrogen - requires filtering

**For beginners:** Start with pure oxygen (Oxite), add nitrogen later when you have the infrastructure.

### CO2, Pollutant, Volatiles Buildup

When humans breathe, they exhale CO2. Over time, CO2 builds up in your base. This is normally ok because you can use it to feed your plants and it has to be very high to cause poisoning. This is untry for Pollutant and Volatiles, so you want to filter those if any are present. Check your room air makeup with your atmos catridge in your tablet.

**Solutions:**

**Option 1: Portable Scrubber (Starter Kit)**

Your kit includes a **Kit (Portable Scrubber)**.

How it works:
1. Build the scrubber
2. Insert the **Pollutant Filter & Volatiles Filter** in the back. They came with your scrubber.
3. Power with battery (uses 20.5W)
4. It absorbs Volatiles & Pollutant from the room air

When the internal tank fills (8106 kPa), the scrubber flashes an error. You need to empty it:
- Bring it outside
- Pull the lever to vent (releases any gases it is filtering)

**Option 2: Permanent Filtration**

Later, you'll want permanent filtration in your pipe network. This requires:
- Filtration Unit or Air Filtration System
- Gas Filters
- Pipe infrastructure

For now, the Portable Scrubber handles it. If your base is big enough there won't be an issue for a long time.

### Checking Your Atmosphere

Use your **Tablet with Atmospheric Analyzer Cartridge**:
- Shows temperature
- Shows pressure
- Shows gas composition (percentages)

Calculate partial pressure: Total Pressure × Gas Percentage = Partial Pressure

## Suit Management

While you're setting up your base, you're still relying on your suit. Once you've got an atmosphere propely set up you can open it.

### Refilling Your Suit Oxygen

**Method 1: Room Atmosphere**

If your base has breathable atmosphere:
1. Open your helmet (press **I** - but only if atmosphere is safe!)
2. Your suit will equalize with room atmosphere
3. Close helmet when leaving

**Method 2: Direct from Portable Tank**

1. Take a **Gas Canister** (small canister, not the portable tank)
2. Place it in the striped slot on top of the Portable Tank
3. The canister fills with oxygen
4. Take the canister
5. Open your suit inventory (press **3**)
6. Replace your air canister with the full one

### Emptying Your Waste Tank

Your suit's waste tank collects filtered CO2. When it exceeds ~4052 kPa, your filters stop working. Vent this inside your base so you can feed your plants!

**To vent:**
1. Press **3** to open suit panel
2. Find your waste canister
3. Click on it, select Open
4. CO2 vents to atmosphere


### Filter Lifespan

Your suit's CO2 filters have limited life:
- **Small Filter:** 2 hours
- **Medium Filter:** 10 hours
- **Large Filter:** 40 hours

Filters only degrade when actively filtering CO2. Check your filter status regularly.

## Food and Water

You won't starve in the first hour, but you need to plan ahead.

### Starting Supplies

**In your Orange Uniform (on your body):**
- Cereal Bar
- Water Bottle

**In Survival Supplies crate:**
- 1 Water Bottle Box (4 bottles)
- 2 Cereal Bar Boxes (6 bars each)

**In Your Lander**
- 1 Water Bottle Bag (4 Bottles)
- 1 Cereal Bar Bag (6 Bars)

### Eating and Drinking

**On easier difficulties:** You can consume through your suit.

**On Normal+ difficulties:** You must open your helmet to eat/drink - meaning you need breathable atmosphere first.

**To consume:**
1. Hold the food/water in your hand
2. Open your helmet (if required by difficulty)
3. Left-click to consume

### Food Quality

Food quality affects your maximum hydration:
- Low quality: 75% max hydration
- Best quality: 175% max hydration

Your starting soups are decent quality. For long-term survival, you'll need to grow crops.

### Hunger and Thirst Mechanics

You can let health drop from hunger/thirst and recover later - you don't need to eat constantly. If your health bar gets down to 0 you die.

**Rough timeline (Stationeer difficulty):**
- Starting oxygen: More than a week
- Starting water: About a week
- Starting food: About a week

### Long-term: Growing Food

Your Organic Supplies crate contains seeds:
- Potato, Wheat, Soybean (3 each)
- 6 Fertilized Eggs 

The eggs are going to spoil. Even if you grew them the odds of you having enough wheat to feed the chickens on week 1 are slim to none. Leave the eggs closed and you can rush to build  a fridge to make them last longer. For now...forget about it.

You also have a **Kit (Portable Hydroponics)** in your starter supplies.

**Plants need:**
- Light (sunlight or grow lights)
- Atmosphere (~20°C temperature, appropriate gases)
- Water
- Time

Farming is beyond this beginner guide, but know that it's your long-term food solution.
